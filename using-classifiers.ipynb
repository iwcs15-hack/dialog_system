      "Today's session shows how you can build classifiers to respond to the gist or purpose of an utterance.  Our techniques illustrate what's called [supervised machine learning][1]: finding generalizations from labeled examples that we can use to respond corretly to new, unlabeled examples.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This session draws heavily on the [NLTK toolkit][2].  It has a bunch of convenient functions for doing supervised machine learning, which is helpful.  But there are lots of other good Python utilities for doing machine learning, especially [scikit-learn][3], which gives access to a really wide variety of methods.  NLTK's learning is more of a greatest hits compilation by comparison, but we're only going to use the simplest possible learning method: [naive Bayes classifiers][4]. What NLTK also has is a bunch of bundled training data: collections of language that have been marked up by hand to indicate the answers to important questions.  In order to do machine learning, we need that kind of training data.\n",

      "We're going to focus on two problems that are particularly relevant for a chatbot.  \n",
      "- The first is [sentiment analysis][5], which is understanding whether a comment conveys positive or negative information.  The idea is that we'll be able to classify the user's input, and be able to respond appropriately with markers of feedback like _Cool!_ or _Too bad..._  Obviously you don't want to use these the wrong way!\n",
      "- The second is *dialogue act tagging*, a problem first explored in [this journal paper][6], which is understand the kind of contribution that somebody is making to a conversation with an utterance.  It's not always easy to tell whether a statement is supposed to give new information or comment on something that's been said before, or whether a question is asking for clarification or proposing a new topic for conversation.  However, there are some cues and patterns in text that we can learn from data, so that our chatbot can respond differently to these different moves.\n",

      "We'll start with sentiment analysis.  This code has a few sources.  The first is [Chapter 6 of the NLTK Book][1].  This gives a good overview of supervised learning and the interfaces that NLTK offers for dealing with the data.  The second is [a series of blog posts by Jacob Perkins][2].  (I've given you the link to the first post in the series, but they're all linked together.)  Perkins is a much better source about how to represent documents, select features and evaluate the results.  I've also consulted [Chris Potts's tutorial about sentiment analysis][3] which is a nice mix of academic and practical.\n",

      "My goal here, by the way, is to show you some techniques that are known to have good results and illustrate the process of using machine learning to make decisions in a program.  This is not the whole picture, and there's a lot more to say about how you go about using machine learning carefully and creatively for a new problem.  Some of the shortcuts that I'm using here (like training on all the available data, without saving anything for development and testing) could lead to very bad reslults if we had to tinker to put the program together rather than just reusing techniques that other people have already worked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this classification problem, we represent a text snippet as a collection of features.  The features in a document list the _informative_ words that _occur_ in the document.  There are a couple choices here that are not obvious but are important.\n",
      "- We use _informative_ words so that the learning algorithm and the final classifier do not get confused by irrelevant information.  Noisy features can make it harder for the learner to lock on to what really matters for a decision; it requires more search and more data to be able to find the real correlations in the presence of many unreliable features, so we'll just get rid of the stuff that's not likely to be useful.  We'll measure informativeness statistically, using a $\\chi^2$ statistic derived from the prevalence of feature counts among positive or negative examples.  The $\\chi^2$ statistic says how unlikely your observed feature counts are to have been derived by chance.  The more unlikely they are, the higher the $\\chi^2$ statistic, and the better evidence the feature gives you about the true category of the data.\n",
      "- We only have features for the words that _occur_ in the document.  The NLTK book suggests that you have features for the words that occur in the document _and_ for the words that do not occur in the document, but this does not work very well in our setting.  Normally in supervised classification problem, the features are the most meaningful measurements that you can get automatically from your data to make a decision.  If you're diagnosing a disease, for example, you might decide to do a particular blood test and then record whether the outcome of the test is positive or negative.  Observing a word in a review isn't really like this.  You'd like to know whether the reviewer thought the movie was, say, _interesting_ (which is probably a good thing) but that's not the same thing as whether the reviewer actually used the word _interesting_ in the review.  The gap is particularly important in short utterances like you get in a chatbot - normally most words aren't going to be used because the utterances are short, so you don't really get any evidence that the user didn't think something just because they don't use that word.  Naive Bayes models can handle this easily because the probability models apply when you observe any subset of features -- features that you haven't observed can just be ignored in your learning and decision making.\n",

It also gets the recognized sentiment of the input text as an argument, so it can potentially do something different depending on whether the input is recognized as expressing a positive opinion or a negative opinion.\n",

So the basic pattern of a response is to classify the act and sentiment of the input, and then call the response generator for the recognized act with the original text and the recognized sentiment.  \n",
